 <h3> What is CATSS?</h3>
 
 Time of Flight Magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) is a commonly used imaging technique in clinical and research environments to examine the cerebral arterial tree. However, analyzing the whole brain arterial vasculature requires skilled experts to intervene manually, making it time-consuming and inconsistent, especially for multiclass segmentations. To address this, we developed CATSS a fully automated method that segments the cerebral arterial tree, and labels its arteries.
